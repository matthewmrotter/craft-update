## Freeform Overview

Freeform centers itself around the idea of letting admins and/or clients enjoy the experience of building and managing simple or complex forms in an intuitive interface that lets you see a live preview of the forms you're building. We call this Composer, where almost everything is at your fingertips as it aims to stay out of your way and let you do as much as possible without having to move around to other areas in the control panel. At the same time, Freeform is very powerful and flexible, so there is also a wide variety of other features, settings and options.

Freeform uses its own set of fields and field types. Fields are global and available to all forms, but they can also be overwritten per form. This allows you to save time reusing existing fields when making other forms, but also gives you flexibility to make adjustments to them when needed. So to clarify, you can create fields with labels and options that are common to all forms, but also override those on each form. An advanced set of fields are available with purchase of Freeform Pro.

Email notifications are global and can be reused for multiple forms, saving you time when you are managing many forms. Freeform allows you to send email notifications upon submittal of a form 5 different ways, each with their own content/template. Email templates can be managed within Craft control panel (saved to database), or as HTML template files.

Freeform attempts to do all the heavy lifting when it comes to templating. Our looping templating approach allows you to automate all or almost all of your form formatting.

Freeform also allows for true multi-page forms, has its own built in spam protection service, and Freeform Pro supports several popular Mailing List and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) API integrations, including MailChimp, dotmailer, Constant Contact, Campaign Monitor, Salesforce and HubSpot.
Freeform also allows for true multi-page forms, has its own built in spam protection service (including **reCAPTCHA** for *Pro* edition), allows you to map/connect your submission data to Craft Elements, and *Freeform Pro* supports several popular Mailing List and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) API integrations, including MailChimp, Constant Contact, Campaign Monitor, Salesforce, HubSpot and Pipedrive.

Freeform Pro edition also includes Conditional Rules logic that can be added to forms. This feature allows you to effortlessly set fields to show or hide based on the contents/selection of other fields, and even skip pages based on the contents/selection of fields on a previous page.

Also available for Freeform is the [Freeform Payments](https://solspace.com/craft/freeform/docs/payments) add-on plugin, which adds support for Stripe payments on forms. Works with both Lite and Pro editions.

Last but not least, included with Freeform is a set of Demo Templates that can be installed on your site, instantaneously giving you a real-world set of styled, working templates.
